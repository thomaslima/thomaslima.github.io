    image: "/images/IMG_7752_cropped.jpeg"
    content: |-
      I come from Brazil but live in Princeton, NJ, USA, and currently work as a researcher at NEC Labs America.
      As a member of the IEEE Photonics Society and the Optica Society, I am constantly exploring new research avenues and contribute to advancing knowledge in my field.
      Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, hiking and landscape photography ([flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/people/197302687@N07/)). With my fujifilm camera, I seek to capture the beauty of light in nature while traveling or hiking.
      See my [online CV](cv/) for more professional details.
